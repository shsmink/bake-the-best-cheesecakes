**INSTRUCTIONS**
 
1. Preheat oven to 170 fan
2. Line an 8 inch springform tin with parchment paper on the base and sides.
3. Crust – melt the vegan butter over a low heat, crush digestives to a fine breadcrumb texture and mix all together in a bowl with the sugar.
4. Press the base mixture into the lined tin in an even layer, compacting it and pressing up the sides of the tin 1-2 inches all the way around. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes then allow to cool fully while making the filling.
5. To make the filling, melt the vegan butter over a low heat. Zest and juice the lemon. Add all the filling ingredients except the cream cheese to a food processor, sieve in the cornstarch. Blend on medium speed for 2-3 minutes until lovely and smooth. Add the vegan cream cheese to the processor and blend until incorporated, 1-2 minutes. Pour the filling into the springform with the base. Spreading the top evenly.
6. Bake on the middle rack of the preheated oven for 1 hour, rotating carefully half way through cooking time so the top browns evenly. Bake until firm but still slightly wobbly in the centre . Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool in the tin for at least an hour.
7. Once at room temperature, refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight, works really well and is highly advised.
8. To prepare the berry topping, add the frozen berries, sugar and lemon juice to the saucepan and sieve in the cornstarch. Bring to a boil and leave to simmer for 2-3 mins, pressing some of the strawberries so that they give off some more juice. Take off the heat and transfer to a wide bowl to let cool before adding on top
9. Pour the berry sauce over the baked cheesecake (once its fully cooled and set) slice and enjoy this wonderful cake!
